        # Using a container  makes it easy to re-use workflows with different

        # one wanted to use a new DB. Using a container makes it easy to
        # configure that dependency.

        # @example
        #   LegacySystem = Dry::Container.new.tap do |c|

        # Configures the result aggregator
        #
        # Aggregators make is possible to build custom logic about
        # how results should be "merged" together. For example,
        # yuo could build and aggregator that prioritizes the
        # values of some tasks over others.
        #
        # @example
        #   class EnhanceUserProfile
        #     extend Attr::Gather::Workflow
        #
        #     aggregator :deep_merge

        # Defines a filter for filtering out invalid values
        #
        # When aggregating data from many sources, it is hard to reason about
        # all the ways invalid data will be returned. For example, if you are
        # pulling data from a spreadsheet, there will often be typos, etc.
        #
        # Defining a filter allows you to declaratively state what is valid.
        # attr-gather will use this definition to automatically filter out
        # invalid values, so they never make it into your system.
        #
        # Filtering happens during each step of the workflow, which means that
        # every Task will receive validated input that you can rely on.
        #
        # @example
        #   class UserContract < Dry::Validation::Contract do
        #     params do
        #       optional(:id).filled(:integer)
        #       optional(:email).filled(:str?, format?: /@/)
        #     end
        #   end
        #
        #   class EnhanceUserProfile
        #     extend Attr::Gather::Workflow
        #
        #     # Any of the key/value pairs that had validation errors will be
        #     # filtered from the output.
        #     filter :contract, UserContract.new
        #   end
        #
        # @param filt [Symbol] the name filter to use
        # @param args [Array<Object>] arguments for initializing the filter
        #
        # @api public
        def filter(filt = nil, *args)
          if filt.nil? && !defined?(@filter)
            @filter = Filters.default
            return @filter
          end

          @filter = Filters.resolve(filt, *args) if filt
          @filter
