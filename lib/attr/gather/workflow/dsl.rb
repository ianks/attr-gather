        # Defines a filter for filtering out invalid values
        #
        # When aggregating data from many sources, it is hard to reason about
        # all the ways invalid data will be returned. For example, if you are
        # pulling data from a spreadsheet, there will often be typos, etc.
        #
        # Defining a filter allows you to declaratively state what is valid.
        # attr-gather will use this definition to automatically filter out
        # invalid values, so they never make it into your system.
        #
        # Filtering happens during each step of the workflow, which means that
        # every Task will receive validated input that you can rely on.
        #
        # @example
        #   class UserContract < Dry::Validation::Contract do
        #     params do
        #       optional(:id).filled(:integer)
        #       optional(:email).filled(:str?, format?: /@/)
