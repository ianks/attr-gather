```ruby
# create a container with task implementations
class UserContainer
  extend Dry::Container::Mixin

  register "fetch_database_info" do |id:, **_attrs|
    repo = UsersRepository.new
    user = repo.by_pk(id).one

    { nickname: user.nickname, email: user.email }
  end

  register "fetch_avatar_info" do |email:, **_attrs|
    api = GravatarAPI.new
    profile = api.get_user_by_email(email)

    { avatar: profile[:avatar] }
  end
end

# define a workflow
class EnhanceUserProfile
  extend Attr::Gather::Workflow

  container UserContainer

  task :fetch_database_info do |t|
    t.depends_on = []
  end

  task :fetch_avatar_info do |t|
    t.depends_on = [:fetch_gravatar_info]
  end
end

# run the workflow
enhancer = EnhanceUserProfile.new
enhancer.call(id: 123) # => { id: 123, email: 'test@test.com', nickname: 'Jay', avatar: 'https://example.com/avatar.png' }
